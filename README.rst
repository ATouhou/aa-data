This repository holds the image files used by the 
Arabic Almanac website which can be found here:
`http://ejtaal.net/aa <http://ejtaal.net/aa>`_.

This repository may be deleted and re-created as
deleting/committing large amounts of binary files
would needlessly consume space on github's servers,
while only the most up to date version of the images
are required for the website to function.

Tools used
==========

All images were processed on linux using the following tools:
- pdftools
- ImageMagick
- ScanTailor

Procedure
=========

The images are typically contained in pdf files which contain
scanned images of the pages. Depending on the quality some
pre-processing may be required to cut off borders etc, after which
the images need to be converted into the most space efficient
format we can find.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a catch-all procedure that
produces the best output images for each set of input images. I'll
document for each set which parameters I've used so that I or others
can refer back to this for new projects or for re-creating images
if needed.
